After completing my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering, I joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a Scientist/Engineer in 2014. Over the course of four years, I worked at two major ISRO centres—Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and U. R. Rao Satellite Centre—where I was involved in the structural design and analysis of launch vehicle subsystems, as well as the dynamic testing of satellites.

During my time at ISRO, I became fascinated by the capabilities of finite element analysis software such as ANSYS and Abaqus, which are used for structural analysis. My curiosity to understand the underlying mathematical equations and the software development process led me to pursue a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics.

Here are some of the major projects I contributed to at ISRO:

#### 1. Thermo-structural analysis of a DMRJ engine flow duct

The dual model ramjet (DMRJ) engine flow duct experiences a variety of loads (aerodynamics pressure and thermal loads, inertial loads, and pressure and thermal loads due to combustion) during different stages of the vehicle trajectory. 

I contributed towards the thermo-structural analysis of engine flow duct model along with the structural qualification testing of the realized hardware.

#### 2. Payload adapter design for the PSLV

I was part of a design team responsible for developing a new payload adapter design for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) capable of carrying four to six additional small satellites ($\sim$ 100 kg each) along with the primary payload ($\sim$ 1000 kg) of the vehicle.
