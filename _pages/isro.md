After completing my Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering, I joined the `Indian Space Research Organisation` (ISRO) as a Scientist/Engineer in 2014. Over the course of four years, I worked at two major ISRO centres—Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and U. R. Rao Satellite Centre—where I was involved in the structural design and analysis of launch vehicle subsystems, as well as the dynamic testing of satellites.

During my time at ISRO, I became fascinated by the capabilities of `finite element analysis` software such as ANSYS and Abaqus, which are used for structural analysis. My curiosity to understand the underlying mathematical equations and the software development process led me to pursue a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics.

Here are some of the major projects I contributed to at ISRO:

#### 1. Thermo-structural analysis of a DMRJ engine flow duct

The `dual model ramjet` (DMRJ) engine flow duct experiences a variety of loads (aerodynamics pressure and thermal loads, inertial loads, and pressure and thermal loads due to combustion) during different stages of the vehicle trajectory. 

I contributed towards the thermo-structural analysis of engine flow duct model along with the structural qualification testing of the realized hardware.

#### 2. Payload adapter design for the PSLV

I was part of a design team responsible for developing a new payload adapter design for the `Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle` (PSLV) capable of carrying four to six additional small satellites ($\sim$ 100 kg each) along with the primary payload ($\sim$ 1000 kg) of the vehicle.

#### 3. Thermal screen development for GSLV

Thermal screen, a flexible and inflatable membrane, is provided over the fore-end dome of liquid hydrogen ($LH_2$) tank of `Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle` (GSLV Mk3) to contain, dilute and expel Hydrogen  gas (if any due to leak) to the  atmosphere and hence to protect the electronic components in the equipment bay above the $LH_2$ tank during filling and liftoff.

I was involved in the design, finite element analysis, and testing of the thermal screen.

#### 4. Structural analysis of reusable launch vehicle's wing 

The wing leading edge of ISRO's `reusable launch vehicle` (RLV) experiences aerodynamic, thermal and inertial loads during its flight. I was involved in the structural analysis (using finite element analysis) and testing of the realized wing leading edge hardware.
