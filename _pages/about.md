<!-- With a background in `Aerospace Engineering` and a PhD in `Applied Mathematics`, I have spent the last eight years solving complex simulation problems, from modeling geophysical flows to evaluating structural loads on rockets and spacecrafts. -->

Hi, my name is Kamal. I am a PhD student at the Mathematics department of [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html). Under the supervision of Dr. Peter Korn (from the [Max Planck Institute for Meteorology](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/homepage)), my research focuses on the use of stochastic parameterization methods to quantify the uncertainty due to unresolved small-scale processes in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). Over the last couple of years, I have developed numerical solvers for various GFD equations, most notably, for a `stochastic coupled ocean atmosphere climate model`.

I hold a bachelor's degree in `Aerospace Engineering` and have worked at the [Indian Space Research Organisation](https://www.isro.gov.in/) (ISRO) for four years. During my time at ISRO, I conducted structural design, analysis, and testing of different launch vehicle subsystems. I was fascinated by the software used to carry out structural analysis. Curiosity to the understand the underlying mathematical equations and the software development process led me to pursue a Masters in `Applied Mathematics` and eventually a `PhD`.

This website highlights some of the work I did during my PhD and my time at ISRO.
